3_recipes: Creates 4 recipes for tree-based and parametric models.
4_xxx: Contains ALL fittings of each model on baseline recipe (Total of Six Models)
5_xxx: Contains ALL fittings of each model on feature engineered recipe (Total of 5 Models)
6_model_analysis: collects RMSE's of all eleven models
7_Training_Best_Model: Fits winning model onto training/testing data
